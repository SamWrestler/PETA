# PETA Co. - Company Resume Landing Page 

A customizable company website built with Laravel and Blade, featuring a multilingual landing page, dynamic content management panel, and structured MySQL database with support for unlimited languages.



## üöÄ Key Features

* Built with **Laravel MVC**, Blade templating, and **Eloquent ORM**
* Full **multilingual support** with database-driven translations
* **Admin-authenticated CMS panel** to manage all landing-page sections
* Dynamic content blocks: hero, services, about us, team, contact, footer
* **Responsive UI** with Bootstrap/Tailwind (via Vite)
* SEO-friendly routing with language prefixes (`/en`, `/fa`, etc.)
* **Contact form** with email notifications using Laravel Mail
* Configurable site settings via `.env` and `config/`
* **Daily content seeding, validation**, and user input sanitization
* File storage with public uploads and media handling
* **Ready for deployment** with Artisan commands and Vite bundling



## How It Works

1. **User visits the site (public pages)**

   * The router (in `routes/web.php`) detects the requested URL (e.g. `/`, `/about`, `/services`).
   * A middleware checks the current locale (e.g. `en` or `fa`) and loads the appropriate language strings from the database.
   * The controller (e.g. `PageController@index`) retrieves content for that page‚Äîtitles, descriptions, images‚Äîvia Eloquent models (`Page`, `Section`, etc.).
   * Blade templates render each section (hero banner, features, testimonials) using conditional loops to output both English and Persian fields.
   * The visitor sees a fully populated, responsive landing page in their chosen language.

2. **Multi-language routing & content loading**

   * A localization middleware prefixes URLs with `/en/`, `/fa/`, etc., so switching languages simply reloads the same controller/action in a different locale.
   * Each database table that stores text has separate columns (or a linked ‚Äútranslations‚Äù table) for `title_en`, `title_fa`, `content_en`, `content_fa`, allowing unlimited additional languages.
   * When a visitor clicks the language switcher, the controller re-queries the same content in the new language and returns the page.

3. **Admin logs in & opens the CMS dashboard**

   * The ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù middleware in `app/Http/Middleware/` guards all `/admin/*` routes. Only authenticated, authorized users (via Laravel‚Äôs Auth scaffolding) can proceed.
   * Upon successful login, the admin is redirected to a dashboard (`AdminController@index`), which shows a list of editable modules: Pages, Sections, Banners, Team, Testimonials, Site Settings, etc.

4. **Editing a landing-page section**

   * The admin clicks ‚ÄúEdit Home Hero‚Äù (for example). A form in Blade appears, prefilled with the existing English/Persian titles, descriptions, and image fields.
   * The admin updates text in both languages and uploads a new image if needed.
   * On submit, a request hits `PageSectionController@update`, which validates each field (`Request` validation rules), saves text to the MySQL database via Eloquent, and stores any uploaded media in `storage/`.
   * The controller clears any cached views and redirects back with a success message.

5. **Managing site settings & configuration**

   * Under ‚ÄúSettings,‚Äù the admin can change global values (`config/site.php`) such as site name, default locale, or contact email.
   * These values are stored in the database or in `.env`, then cached via `config:cache` for fast access on every page load.

6. **Handling the contact form**

   * When a visitor fills out ‚ÄúName, Email, Message‚Äù on the Contact page, the form posts to `ContactController@send`.
   * Server-side validation ensures all fields are present. If valid, Laravel‚Äôs `Mail` fa√ßade sends an email to the admin inbox.
   * A ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù Blade view or JSON response is returned, confirming receipt.

7. **Database seeders & migrations**

   * Running `php artisan migrate --seed` creates all tables (`pages`, `sections`, `languages`, etc.) and populates default content in multiple languages (via seeders).
   * This provides a working site skeleton immediately‚Äîadmin only needs to tweak text rather than build pages from scratch.

8. **Asset compilation & front-end**

   * Front-end assets (SCSS, JS) live in `resources/`. Webpack (via Vite) compiles them into `public/css` and `public/js` with hot-reload in local development.
   * Blade layouts reference compiled files for a responsive, mobile-first UI using Bootstrap or Tailwind classes.

9. **Error handling & logging**

   * Any exceptions (e.g. validation failure, DB error) are caught by Laravel‚Äôs exception handler.
   * Errors are logged to `storage/logs/laravel.log`.
   * Visitors see a friendly 404/500 page generated by Blade.

10. **Deployment flow**

    * On the production server, the deployer runs:

      1. `git pull` (get latest code)
      2. `composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev`
      3. `php artisan migrate --force --seed`
      4. `php artisan config:cache && php artisan route:cache && php artisan view:cache`
      5. `npm run build` (compile front-end)
    * The site remains live with zero-downtime since migrations and caching happen atomically.
